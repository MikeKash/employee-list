# Employee list web-page

**Live version available here:** https://mikekash.github.io/employee-list/

**IMPORTANT!**

In order for this page to work properly you need Allow CORS extention to be installed for Chrome. Otherwise data can't be obtained from the API.

What tasks I had in this project:

1.Get data from API, and render an employee list.
Not all of the employess have pictures, so I decided to add an empty profile picture, so it just looks better.

2. Implement "Add New Employee" button and form and handle entered data in the function.

On top of of what been asked I added pagination as well. Amount of rows is set in the function and can be any. Buttons with page number will be created on the fly depending on the rows amount of rows.

Accomplished this project using HTML, CSS, Bulma and vanilla JavaScript.
