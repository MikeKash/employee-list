# Employee list web-page

**Live version available here:** https://mikekash.github.io/employee-list/

**IMPORTANT!**

Simple, dynamic list of employees with capability to add new employee. Data is taken from an array, but can be taken from API or another data source.

It was made from scratch. So what I needed to do: 
1. Not all of the employess have pictures, so I decided to add an empty profile picture, so it just looks better.
2. Implement "Add New Employee" button and form and handle entered data in the function.
3. Added pagination as well. Amount of rows is set in the function and can be any. Buttons with page number will be created on the fly depending on the rows amount of rows.

Accomplished this project using HTML, CSS, Bulma and vanilla JavaScript.
